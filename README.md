Hi, I’m Agathe Monnot!

After working as a photographer (studio and free-lance), I am now a student at City of Glasgow College, learning Web Development. 

I have passed my HNC with an A grade and I am currently studying towards my HND (ends June 2022).

I wish to use my knowledge in Graphic Design (Visual Communication Bachelor obtained in 2010) and visual arts, paired with my newly gained coding skills, to become a full stack developer.
